# Tutorial: Creating data plots for effective decision-making using statistical inference with R 

Website: [https://dicook.github.io/tutorial_make_better_data_plots/](https://dicook.github.io/tutorial_make_better_data_plots/)

This is for data analysts and statisticians who work regularly with data and want to improve their ability to make effective data visualisations. You will learn general principles that can get you off to a good start in making a data plot, and how to use these to layer up to a more effective communication. It will be hands-on, so we will code together and make the plots and improve them. There will be an opportunity to bring your own plot and data, and work together on making it better.

**Presenter**: Dianne Cook is Professor of Business Analytics at Monash University in Melbourne, Australia.  She is a world leader in data visualisation, especially the visualisation of high-dimensional data using tours with low-dimensional projections, and projection pursuit.  She is currently focusing on bridging the gap between exploratory graphics and statistical inference.  Di is a Fellow of the American Statistical Association, past editor of the Journal of Computational and Graphical Statistics, current editor of the R Journal, elected Ordinary Member of the R Foundation, and elected member of the International Statistical Institute.

**Background**: Participants should have a beginners knowledge of R, an awareness of tidy data, and ggplot2. Familiarity with the material in [R4DS](https://r4ds.hadley.nz) is helpful.

## Getting started

1. (This is a head start, but final list available before tutorial) You should have a reasonably up to date version of R and R Studio, eg RStudio 2024.09.0 +375 and R version 4.5.0 (2025-04-11). Install the following packages, and their dependencies.

```
install.packages(c("ggplot2", "tidyr", "dplyr", "readr", "stringr", "nullabor", "colorspace", "palmerpenguins", "broom", "ggbeeswarm", "vcd", "MASS", "conflicted"), dependencies=c("Depends", "Imports"))
```

2. Download the [Zip file of materials (COMING)]() to your laptop, and unzip it. 

3. Download just the R scripts,  (COMING)

4. Open your RStudio be clicking on `tutorial.Rproj`.
